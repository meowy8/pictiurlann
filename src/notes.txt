priority:
- implement a search feature for the articles list


fixes:
- learn how to properly use links and grab data so that if you type in the url of an article it take you to the same page as clicking the link to the article
- fix the search bar from updating with the previous value instead of the most recent value
- fix list when you type so that the filtered list is still in the specific order and doesn't reset
